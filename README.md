// Agify API
How do you tell the age of someone from their name? Well, here is a fun little API that you can use. Agify is used for predicting the age of a person given their name. It is free to use for up to 1000 requests/day. You can try out the following in your browser —
https://api.agify.io?name=michael

Bored API
This is something you could add to your personal website, for instance. The Bored API ensures that a user is never bored. When requested, it responds with a random activity for the user to do. You can even customize the type and the number of participants!

#Numbers API
An API for interesting facts about numbers. It provides trivia, math, date, and year facts about numbers. For example, if I look for date facts on February 29th, I get the following result.

MapBox APIs
Serving as an alternative to Google Maps — MapBox provides APIs for four distinct services: Maps, Navigation, Search, and Accounts.

Fun Translations API
The Fun Translations API allows you to use several language APIs under one plan. Some of the many language APIs you get access to include the Yoda API, which translates English to Yodish, a Pig Latin API, and an API to translate Dothraki (from Game of Thrones).

QR Tag API
Need to integrate a QR code into your next project? You can use QR Tag’s API to create a QR code quickly.

Eventbrite API
The Eventbrite API lets you find different events and information about them, like their capacity, pricing, and more. Since I recently became a developer advocate and am trying to speak at as many events as possible, I’m starting to think about different ways to use this data myself.

Quickchart API
Side projects can always benefit from graphs. Whatever your side project is, adding a few graphs is always fun. You can use the Quickchart API to quickly add bar graphs, pie graphs, and more to your next side project.

https://quickchart.io/chart?c={type:'bar',data:{labels:['Q1','Q2','Q3','Q4'], datasets:[{label:'Users',data:[50,60,70,180]},{label:'Revenue',data:[100,200,300,400]}]}}
